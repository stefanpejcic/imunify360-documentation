This will show you an overview of available plans you can switch to.</p><p>If you are on a plan that supports an upgrade to Patchman COVERAGE+ (From CORE or COVERAGE respectively), you can select the plan here and upgrade.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-enable-patchman-clean" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-enable-patchman-clean" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do I enable Patchman CLEAN?</h3><p>Once you&#39;ve gained access to a plan that supports the Patchman CLEAN functionality, you are able to configure the option in a number of ways. The first is determining cleaning behaviour and (optional) messaging to end-users within the policy. In order to do this, you can navigate to the policy page (<a href="https://portal.patchman.co/policies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.patchman.co/policies</a>) and select the policy for which you&#39;d like to configure CLEAN. You can then scroll down to the Patchman CLEAN section:</p><p><img src="/images/Policy_Patchman_CLEAN.png" alt=""></p><p>This shows various options, and will be familiar if you&#39;ve used policies before. Essentially, after ticking &#39;Enable dynamic malware scanning&#39; To activate the feature for the selected policy, you can configure when actions are scheduled (for reminders and cleans), whether they should trigger a notification to the end-user to which the detections apply, and if so, what e-mail template should be used. As with other sections, the e-mail templates are fully customisable.</p><p>The option &#39;Allow manual clean actions&#39;, if enabled, allows an end-user to manually trigger Patchman CLEAN actions from within their detection overview (if made available to them via End user login). When disabled, cleans are only triggered automatically.</p><h3 id="additional-configuration-options" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-configuration-options" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Additional configuration options</h3><p>Because the more comprehensive file scanning features added with Patchman CLEAN do introduce more performance impact (see also: <a aria-current="page" href="/patchman/frequently_asked_questions/#what-are-the-minimal-requirements-for-running-patchman" class="router-link-active router-link-exact-active">What are the minimal requirements for running Patchman?</a>), additional configuration options have been added to allow more control over scanning behaviour.

It also makes binding to a source address difficult, meaning that in case of a server with multiple outgoing interfaces the connection to our management server may go over different interfaces on different occasions, leading to licensing troubles.

However, many custom extensions try accessing the session variables directly, which would break after applying this update. Since Patchman wants to only provide fixes that do not break a website under any circumstances (regardless of which extensions are installed) this is a blocking problem for releasing the fix.</p><p><strong>Mitigating factors</strong><br> The vulnerability in PHP that allows the remote code execution was fixed in PHP versions 5.4.45, 5.5.29, 5.6.13 and 7. Several other sources also provided backported security fixes for PHP 5.3. If you are running a PHP version that is still under security support (official or third-party) the vulnerability has been patched in PHP itself and is no longer exploitable regardless of the use of unserialization functions in Joomla.</p><h4 id="_20160803-cross-site-request-forgery-in-com-joomlaupdate" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_20160803-cross-site-request-forgery-in-com-joomlaupdate" aria-hidden="true">#</a> [20160803] Cross-site request forgery in com_joomlaupdate</h4><p><strong>Vulnerability details</strong><br> The Joomla!

Project introduced checks on a new CSRF token, but also required such a token to be generated by the update migration path. Even for a regular update, this introduced complications (see <a href="https://www.joomla.org/announcements/release-news/5666-the-joomla-3-6-1-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this official announcement</a>). It would be very complicated for us to backport this security fix while maintaining functional equivalence of the older installs of the Joomla! Update Component.</p><p><strong>Mitigating factors</strong><br> The worst case scenario that the vulnerability allows is triggering an automatic update from an official upstream source. This may be bad for website owners as it may break compatibility with themes and extensions, but by no means allows malicious attacks such as spam attacks or phishing site uploads (the kind of attacks Patchman prevents). From a server security standpoint, this vulnerability is harmless.</p><h3 id="drupal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#drupal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Drupal</h3><h4 id="sa-core-2022-011-third-party-libraries" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#sa-core-2022-011-third-party-libraries" aria-hidden="true">#</a> [SA-CORE-2022-011] Third-party libraries</h4><p><strong>Vulnerability details</strong><br> Drupal uses the third-party Guzzle library for handling HTTP requests and responses to external services.

With the addition of real-time scanning, Patchman is able to monitor all file changes for all websites in real time. This means that as soon as a file is created or modified, Patchman immediately scans the file and is able to take appropriate action if necessary.</p><h3 id="how-does-real-time-scanning-benefit-me" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-real-time-scanning-benefit-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How does real-time scanning benefit me?</h3><p>Our traditional scanning approach is optimized for vulnerability scanning. Vulnerabilities don’t suddenly appear on your server - instead, they are usually there for some time in a file, until someone discovers that that file actually contains a vulnerability. Our traditional scanning mechanism is able to very quickly find out which files on your server are vulnerable once such a new vulnerability is discovered, due to our combination of daily scanning, intelligent ad hoc scanning and file state caching.</p><p>Malware, however, usually appears suddenly. Relying on daily scanning here means that a malware file can be on your server for hours before we find it, and in many cases, the damage of that malware has already been done. For this reason, we need to be able to find out about a file as soon as it appears, so that we can immediately scan it for malware, and don’t have to wait for the next daily scan.</p><p>The real-time scanning in Patchman relies on the Linux Audit Framework, which keeps track of all file changes across your entire server. As soon as a file change is spotted that we are interested in, the file is scanned by Patchman. If the file indeed contains malware, the appropriate remediation action will be taken immediately, per your policy configuration.</p><p>While this mechanism can also pick up vulnerabilities faster, we don’t consider this to be an impactful application of real-time scanning. It is thus primarily of use for malware detection, which is why it is a part of our advanced malware remediation package, Patchman CLEAN.</p><h3 id="how-do-i-enable-real-time-scanning" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-enable-real-time-scanning" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How do I enable real-time scanning?</h3><p>For technical reasons, a key piece of functionality has to be installed separately from the main patchman-client package. Our automatic installation script can handle this for you, both on new servers and those that already have Patchman installed. Simply re-run the command listed in the Portal (under Servers -&gt; Add Server) and you will be asked whether you want real-time scanning enabled.</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>Do you also want to use real-time scanning?

It might be disabled if you use a custom kernel; in that case, refer to your compilation parameters.</p><p>Most configurations (including defaults) for the Linux Audit Framework are safe to use with Patchman real-time scanning. However, if you have customized it, we strongly recommend you check the following 2 settings:</p><ul><li>Depending on your distribution, check /etc/audit/auditd.conf or /etc/audispd/audispd.conf for a setting called <code>overflow_action</code>. The values <code>ignore</code> or <code>syslog</code> are safe. We do not support this value being set to <code>suspend</code>, <code>single</code> or <code>halt</code>.</li><li>Check the output of the command <code>auditctl -s</code>, and verify that the line starting with <code>failure</code> is set to either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. We do not support this value being set to <code>2</code>.</li></ul><p>Configuring the above against our recommendations would risk inadvertent halting or suspension of your server as an unwanted side effect, and as such we strongly advise against such configuration if you are using Patchman real-time scanning. We can’t provide support for problems of any sorts if your configuration goes against the above recommendations.</p><h3 id="which-limitations-does-real-time-scanning-have" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#which-limitations-does-real-time-scanning-have" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Which limitations does real-time scanning have?</h3><p>In our initial release, real-time scanning is not always able to properly resolve events in chrooted environments. The most common scenario affected by this is uploading a file by FTP, if the FTP daemon is configured to use chroots, as is common across control panel software. We are currently working on improvements in our next release which will capture such events correctly.</p><p>If you are unsure whether our implementation is catching or missing events, feel free to <a href="/patchman/getting_started/#contact-us" class="">contact us</a> so we can take a look if we can do more to improve our solution for your needs!</p></div><div class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><img src="/global/pen.svg" alt="icon pen"><a href="https://github.com/cloudlinux/imunify360-documentation/tree/master/docs/patchman/frequently_asked_questions/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit this page</a></div></div><div class="back-to-top" data-v-1eb13e00><a class="nav-arrow top back-to-top__link" data-v-1eb13e00><span class="back-to-top__link-span" data-v-1eb13e00>Scroll up</span></a></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><!----><div class="footer footer-default-layout" data-v-f2902e71><div class="footer__img" data-v-f2902e71><a href="https://cloudlinux.com" data-v-f2902e71><img src="/global/we-are-cloudlinux.svg" data-v-f2902e71></a></div><div class="footer-company-title" data-v-f2902e71>2024.
