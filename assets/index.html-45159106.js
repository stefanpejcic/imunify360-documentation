This only takes a few minutes and requires just a few simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Find your license key</strong></p><p>Make sure you are logged in to the Patchman Portal at <a href="https://portal.patchman.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.patchman.co</a>. Navigate to the &quot;Add server&quot; option in the menu bar on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Located here is your license key, that you will need during the installation of the agent on a new server.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"></p><p>If this key is compromised, you can revoke it and generate a new one.</p></div><p><strong>Step 2: Install agent</strong></p><p>On the command line of the server you would like to install Patchman on, execute the following command:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>wget https://download.patchman.co/install-patchman.sh &amp;&amp; /bin/bash -e install-patchman.sh &amp;&amp; rm -f install-patchman.sh
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>This downloads the install script for the Patchman agent, installs the agent, and then starts the Patchman daemon. The install script uses your operating systems&#39; package manager (apt or yum) to install the agent, and performs a few checks to make sure your server is suitable for installing Patchman.</p><p>During the installation, the script will ask you for the license key you found in step one. After entering the key, the server will request and set up a license for your server and start connecting to the Portal.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Verify installation</strong></p><p>When the Patchman agent on the server is running, it is time to confirm the connection to your account in the Portal.</p><p>In step 3 of the &quot;Add server&quot; window in the Portal, there is a button called &quot;Verify addition&quot;. When you click this button, the Portal will check if it can connect with your server, which if successful should give you a message like this:</p><p><img src="`+p+'" alt=""></p><p>When you see this message on your dashboard, you can click the message&#39;s link to add your new server. The only thing you need to do now is to verify the information and approve the connection of the server:</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>Once you have verified the process went well, your first server has been added successfully!</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p><p>Please note that it might take a while for your server to connect to the Portal. This can depend on the amount of traffic we currently have queued. Any disturbances in our service are reported on the dashboard and on our <a href="https://status.patchman.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status page</a>. If the server is not connecting after you&#39;ve installed the agent, please double-check if Patchman is running correctly on your server. If the agent is running without any issues, please allow for some time for the server to connect. A message will automatically pop up on your dashboard once your server has connected to the Portal.</p>',34),x=r('<h2 id="insights-quick-start-guide" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#insights-quick-start-guide" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Insights Quick Start Guide</h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"></p><p>This guide is meant for people who have newly signed up for the Patchman Insights trial. In this brief guide you&#39;ll go from the signup process to taking a look at detections for your server(s).</p><p>If you don&#39;t have an account yet, and are interested in trying Patchman, you can sign up for our free Insights trial here: <a href="https://portal.patchman.co/user/signup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.patchman.co/user/signup/</a>.</p></div><p><strong>Step 1: Access the Portal</strong></p><p>In order to get started, log onto the Patchman management portal, found at <a href="https://portal.patchman.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://portal.patchman.co</a></p><p>The Portal is the central environment that allows you to manage and configure Patchman, as well as gain insight regarding the problems it finds and fixes for your servers and users.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Adding the first server</strong></p><p>Once you&#39;re logged in, the next step is to add your first server so you can start scanning. You can click the Portal&#39;s Dashboard notification:</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>Or navigate to the &quot;Add server&quot; option in the left hand menu:</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p><p>On the Add server page, you can find the instructions for installing the Patchman Agent on the server you&#39;re adding, and for adding and activating the license key that allows the agent  to be linked to your Portal account.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Set scan times</strong></p><p>If desired, you can now navigate to the &quot;Servers&quot; menu option, in order to configure the scan timing for the newly added server:</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt=""></p><p>This allow you to determine when Patchman should run the daily scan for this server, usually during low activity hours.
