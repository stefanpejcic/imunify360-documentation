If you are not using one of these panels, Patchman will show the following message in the logs:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>ERROR: Could not determine platform software, unable to activate integrations
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers" aria-hidden="true"><div class="line-number"></div></div></div><p>You will still be able to use Patchman, but rather than use one of our standard integration methods you will have to provide some data to Patchman yourself, using our API.</p><p><strong>Why does Patchman need to integrate with my control panel?</strong></p><p>The integration is required to associate appropriate metadata with the files and directories Patchman scans. Using this metadata, the Patchman Portal is able to provide a per-user detailed overview of detections, giving you insight into the detections for each customer. On top of that, you are able to configure specific details easily based on e.g. the user level or the reseller that owns a certain customer. If you use the notification system offered by Patchman, the software also needs to know which e-mail addresses to use when sending e-mails regarding certain files.</p><p>In the control panel itself, Patchman can offer a single sign-on button for customers to provide them access to the Patchman detection overview for their webhosting account. You configure the access to this button in the Portal, but the buttons themselves are made available in the panel using this integration.</p><p>For the most common control panels, we maintain these integrations ourselves and ship them with Patchman by default. If you are running a different panel, you will need to provide the required data and integration interfaces yourself.</p><p><strong>How do I enable custom integration methods for my account?</strong></p><p>Use of the custom integration method needs to be enabled by the Patchman staff. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@patchman.co">support@patchman.co</a> with information about your control panel and platform, so we can help you with setting up and configuring the integration method on your servers.</p><p><strong>Developing the integration</strong></p><p>The manual for developing all components required for the integration is attached below. It contains all steps required for creating the different components, and contains illustrative examples to help you get started.</p><p><a href="/Patchman_custom_integration.pdf">PDF: &quot;Patchman Custom Integration&quot;</a></p><p>In the sections below, you can find a quick overview of the general steps involved in integrating Patchman with your control panel. For any technical details, please refer to the attached manual. If you still have questions after reading the documentation, please contact <a href="mailto:support@patchman.co">support@patchman.co</a> for more information.</p><p><strong>Providing data to Patchman</strong></p><p>The following information needs to be provided to Patchman for each user in your control panel:</p><ul><li>Username</li><li>User language</li><li>E-mail addresses</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"></p><p>E-mail addresses are only required when using notifications</p></div><ul><li>Home directory</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title"></p><p>Home directory is only required when using per-user audit logging</p></div><ul><li>User level</li><li>Parent user</li><li>Domains</li><li>Directories per domain</li></ul><p>The data needs to be provided in JSON format. You have the option of writing scripts that provide the JSON data directly on demand, or generating JSON files in a predetermined location for Patchman to read.</p><p>Note that these scripts or files are always stored on the webserver for which they provide metadata, and are always called locally by the patchmand process.</p><p><strong>Handling data provided by Patchman</strong></p><p>For the single sign-on buttons, Patchman generates data on the webserver in question that you can use when creating the buttons in your control panel. This concerns a file specifying which users are granted access to the Portal based on your policy settings, and on which level they have access.</p><hr><h2 id="why-does-my-directory-synchronization-fail-on-plesk" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-my-directory-synchronization-fail-on-plesk" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does my directory synchronization fail on Plesk?</h2><p>The directory tracking database is synchronized with Plesk using the Plesk XML-RPC API.

This address is considered the default API availability and thus is what Patchman will try. There are two possible resolutions for this problem:</p><ol><li>Change the Plesk API ACL to allow requests from 127.0.0.1. In the Plesk interface, this can be found under Tools &amp; Settings &gt; IP Access Restriction Management &gt; IP allow/deny list.</li><li>Change the address Patchman uses to access the API. This approach is only useful if the API is made available on an external interface instead of an internal one - it won’t work if you made the API completely unavailable. To achieve this, add the following to <code>/etc/patchman/patchman.ini</code> (create the file if it doesn’t exist yet):<div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>[plesk]

It is strongly recommended to check if Plesk is working correctly; the default timeout for Patchman is 15 minutes, so if the API is indeed slower than that, it is probably having performance problems.
