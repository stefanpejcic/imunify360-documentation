This helps to reduce server load and increase scanning speed dramatically.</li><li><strong>Skip images and other media files</strong> It configures antivirus to check all files besides media files and documents. This also helps to reduce server load and increase scanning speed dramatically. The difference between previous option is that enabled <em>Skip images…</em> makes antivirus scan unknown extensions, but <em>Quick scan</em> will skip them.</li><li><strong>Optimize scanning by speed</strong> It configures antivirus to turn on an “intelligent mode” while scanning cache folders. It will scan files from cache folders selectively which sometimes dramatically speed up the scanning process with the same level of malware detection.</li><li><strong>Max working threads</strong> It specifies the amount of concurrent scanning threads, i.e how many websites will be scanned or cleaned concurrently. By default it is limited by a half of CPU core number. So if your server has 8 cores, the antivirus allows you to configure 4 concurrent threads as maximum. But you can set it to 1 or 2 just to reduce server load during the scanning process.</li><li><strong>Scheduled rescanning</strong> It configures the interval of automatic website rescanning: once a day, once a week, once a month or never.

This option is available in the Premium version of antivirus.</li><li><strong>Start automatic scanning at</strong> It configures the exact time of automatic website scanning.</li><li><strong>Notify on website infection via email</strong> It configures antivirus to send out an email notification after scheduled scanning if websites are infected or blacklisted.This option is available in the Premium version of antivirus.</li><li><strong>Max allocated memory…</strong> It configures how much memory is allowed for a single scanning process. If some websites fail to scan try to increase this value. It is limited by 1GB.</li><li><strong>Number of days to keep…</strong> It configures antivirus to keep backup versions of cleaned files. During this period you can restore these files back using “Undo” button.</li><li><strong>Trim malicious files instead of deleting it</strong> It configures antivirus do not delete files when malware is detected but trim it instead. So the file will be 0 length but kept in the file system. If you are 100% sure that all detected malicious files are not included into another files or database so you can uncheck this option and run <em>Cleanup</em>.</li><li><strong>Update antivirus database automatically</strong> It configures antivirus to update malware database automatically every day.

If the user selects to cleanup malware, then the antivirus either removes a piece of malicious injection in the file or removes the entire file depending on the detected threat.</p><p>If the entire file is a web-shell or doorway or some other type of malicious file, then antivirus removes it entirely. If there’s only a small injection at the beginning or at the end, or somewhere in the middle of the file, the exact malicious piece of code will be removed, but the rest content is left unchanged. Generally, the antivirus removes the malware and keeps a website up and running.</p><p>There’s an option in the settings which defines whether the file is to be removed or just truncated (content of the file is completely removed but the file itself is left on the file system empty and has zero file length).</p><p>The truncation is safer than removal because if the file is included in a database template or some other system file or a config file then the website might become broken after a cleanup. Therefore the antivirus uses a safer cleanup by default to keep the website working properly all the time. But one can disable this option in the Settings so the antivirus will remove the file completely in case the entire file is malware.</p><h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#faq" aria-hidden="true">#</a> FAQ</h2><h3 id="does-imunifyav-protect-websites" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#does-imunifyav-protect-websites" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Does ImunifyAV protect websites?</h3><p>ImunifyAV is a comprehensive malware detection and removal tool.
